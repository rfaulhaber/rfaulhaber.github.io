Welcome to my site. 

I am a full-stack and mobile software developer based in Cleveland, Ohio. My 
main interests are anything related to JavaScript, Go, and Rust. Additionally, 
I am AWS certified.  

`// TODO link to AWS certification!`

I have experience writing apps using (but not limited to):

- React / React Native
- Android
- AWS (mostly RDS, AppSync, and Lambda)

Additionally, my GitHub is filled with projects written in the languages above.

This site is currently a work in progress and was generated using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io).

Please see my [GitHub](https://github.com/rfaulhaber) for more information.
