Today&amp;rsquo;s entry: Magit, a Git interface for Emacs.
I&amp;rsquo;m not much of a Git client person myself. I don&amp;rsquo;t use or particularly like Sourcetree or GitKraken. VS Code and JetBrains IDEs have some nice features, especially when it comes to merging and rebasing, but they&amp;rsquo;re still not quite like Magit.</description></item><item><title>Cool Emacs Things: Edit Files Over SSH</title><link>/posts/cool-emacs-tramp/</link><pubDate>Sat, 22 Aug 2020 14:43:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>/posts/cool-emacs-tramp/</guid><description>This is the first installment of an indefinite series calling (in lieu of a better name) &amp;ldquo;Cool Emacs Things,&amp;rdquo; little things about Emacs that makes it a very handy editor.
Today&amp;rsquo;s entry: Editing files over SSH.
This was something I discovered recently by accident. I run a private email server and the IMAP portion of the server is handled by Dovecot. Dovecot is great but by default the configuration is spread across dozens of files, and, while trying to tediously edit multiple files over SSH in Vim, I thought, &amp;ldquo;Wouldn&amp;rsquo;t it be nice if I could do this with Emacs?</description></item><item><title>Writing an Emacs module in Rust</title><link>/posts/first-emacs-module-rust/</link><pubDate>Fri, 14 Aug 2020 14:30:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>/posts/first-emacs-module-rust/</guid><description>&lt;p>Recently I learned that Emacs supports linking with dynamic modules, so I tried writing one in Rust.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Ways Emacs Has Changed What I Do</title><link>/posts/things-emacs-has-changed/</link><pubDate>Thu, 23 Jul 2020 22:58:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>/posts/things-emacs-has-changed/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://ryanfaulhaber.com/posts/try-emacs/">Previously&lt;/a> I had written about trying Emacs, but looking back on that post I felt like I was bit vague about the ways in which it&amp;rsquo;s changed the things I do, so I wanted to provide some examples.
