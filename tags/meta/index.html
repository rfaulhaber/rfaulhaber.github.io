Part of the reason why I think is because, among other reasons, Emacs represents a lost horizon for what a computer program could be.
Emacs is easy to customize (assuming you know Lisp, which anymore may be a big assumption), and in my experience, easier than Atom or VS Code. In fact, I feel that I can do more in ten lines of Lisp than I can do in 100 of a JavaScript extension for VS Code.</p></div><footer><a href=/posts/notes-on-techno-pessimism/><nobr>Read more →</nobr></a></footer></article><article class=post><header><h2><a href=/posts/aoc-2020-so-far/>My Advent of Code 2020 So Far</a></h2><div class=post-meta>Sun, Dec 13, 2020 - 8 min</div></header><div class=summary><p>This is my first year participating in Advent of Code.

This is a question I have personally addressed before with regards to Emacs, but I want to address this post specifically because I think it gets at a commonly held misunderstanding about these editors.
The basic point of the post explores why people would want to use an antiquated editor like Vim or Emacs, and that those who continue to use either are missing out on the so-called magic of a newer IDE.</p></div><footer><a href=/posts/critique-of-modern-ides/><nobr>Read more →</nobr></a></footer></article></div></main></body><footer id=footer><p id=copyright></p></footer></html>
