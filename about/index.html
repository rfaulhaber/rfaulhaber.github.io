	<h1>About</h1>
	<p>Hello!</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a software developer based in Cleveland, Ohio. I have a wide range of
software interests, ranging from plain old JavaScript development to
programming language theory.</p>
<p>I have been writing JavaScript code since 2014 and consider myself to be
something of an advocate for the language. Much of my framework-related
experience is with React and React Native. I&rsquo;m also currently messing around
with Vue and Electron. My first professional work in software development was
web application development with JavaScript.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been a Linux user for even longer, and the Unix philosophy is always in
the back of my mind. I&rsquo;m passionate about Unix-like systems, as I feel that
they are the only operating systems suitable for software development and for
use as servers.</p>
<p>Above all else, I think code should be simple, readable, and modular. How that
is achieved depends on many factors, and though I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s one magic
bullet to solve this problem, I think it should be a priority in how code and
software is written. Some time ago I was struck by the simple elegance of
conventions in Unix. Being able to write commands like:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">$ echo &quot;8 6 7 5 3 0 9&quot; | tr &quot; &quot; &quot;\n&quot; | sort
</code></pre>
<p>left quite an impression on me.</p>
<p>Similarly, learning about functional programming has also left an impression on
me. Thinking of programs as transformations of data has been revelatory, and
influences all the code I write, functional or not. It has also helped me
achieve my goals of writing simple, readable, and modular code.</p>
<p>Recently I&rsquo;ve been writing a <a href="https://github.com/rfaulhaber/dial">lot</a> <a href="https://github.com/rfaulhaber/sc">of</a>
<a href="https://github.com/rfaulhaber/janus-proto">Rust</a>. It&rsquo;s a language I&rsquo;ve become
quite passionate about. Its static typing, elegant syntax, modern design, and
memory safety make it quite appealing to me.</p>
<h2 id="working-with-me">Working with me</h2>
<p>If you are in need of software development work on a contractual, part time
basis (that is, you don&rsquo;t mind me working in the evenings!), please get in
touch. I&rsquo;m familiar with a wide variety of languages, frameworks, tools, and
platforms. If there&rsquo;s something I don&rsquo;t know, I trust that I can figure it out
quickly.</p>
<p>My experience, as stated partially above, includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Web development (JavaScript, React)</li>
<li>Mobile development (Android with Java and Kotlin, React Native)</li>
<li>Development on Amazon Web Services (especially AppSync, DynamoDB, RDS, EC2, ECS)</li>
</ul>
<p>I am <a href="https://www.certmetrics.com/amazon/public/badge.aspx?i=2&amp;t=c&amp;d=2018-09-08&amp;ci=AWS00490765">AWS certified</a>.</p>
