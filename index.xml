      <description>Hello!
I&amp;rsquo;m a software developer based in Cleveland, Ohio. I have a wide range of software interests, ranging from plain old JavaScript development to programming language theory.
I have been writing JavaScript code since 2014 and consider myself to be something of an advocate for the language. Much of my framework-related experience is with React and React Native. I&amp;rsquo;m also currently messing around with Vue and Electron. My first professional work in software development was web application development with JavaScript.</description>
