This is a question I have personally addressed before with regards to Emacs, but I want to address this post specifically because I think it gets at a commonly held misunderstanding about these editors.
The basic point of the post explores why people would want to use an antiquated editor like Vim or Emacs, and that those who continue to use either are missing out on the so-called magic of a newer IDE.</description></item><item><title>Some First Impressions of Nix</title><link>/posts/nix-first-impressions/</link><pubDate>Fri, 28 Aug 2020 22:06:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>/posts/nix-first-impressions/</guid><description>&lt;p>In my relatively few years of software development I&amp;rsquo;ve seen first hand how hard it can be to set up a consistent environment, development or otherwise, across a team, and I think Nix might be a solution.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Cool Emacs Things: Edit Files Over SSH</title><link>/posts/cool-emacs-tramp/</link><pubDate>Sat, 22 Aug 2020 14:43:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>/posts/cool-emacs-tramp/</guid><description>This is the first installment of an indefinite series calling (in lieu of a better name) &amp;ldquo;Cool Emacs Things,&amp;rdquo; little things about Emacs that makes it a very handy editor.
Today&amp;rsquo;s entry: Editing files over SSH.
This was something I discovered recently by accident. I run a private email server and the IMAP portion of the server is handled by Dovecot. Dovecot is great but by default the configuration is spread across dozens of files, and, while trying to tediously edit multiple files over SSH in Vim, I thought, &amp;ldquo;Wouldn&amp;rsquo;t it be nice if I could do this with Emacs?</description></item><item><title>Writing an Emacs module in Rust</title><link>/posts/first-emacs-module-rust/</link><pubDate>Fri, 14 Aug 2020 14:30:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>/posts/first-emacs-module-rust/</guid><description>&lt;p>Recently I learned that Emacs supports linking with dynamic modules, so I tried writing one in Rust.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>You Should Try Linux</title><link>/posts/try-linux/</link><pubDate>Wed, 05 Aug 2020 21:51:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>/posts/try-linux/</guid><description>&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve been using Linux since about 2013 and it&amp;rsquo;s been a consistently rewarding experience.

Here we&amp;rsquo;ll explore what Promises are, why they&amp;rsquo;re needed, and how you can &amp;ldquo;promisify&amp;rdquo; callbacks in JavaScript.
I find a lot of newcomers are often confused by terms like &amp;ldquo;callbacks&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Promises&amp;rdquo;, and what exactly async and await do. I hope to clear that up with this article.
For the sake of clarity, this guide will use function syntax, and not arrow functions.</description></item></channel></rss>
