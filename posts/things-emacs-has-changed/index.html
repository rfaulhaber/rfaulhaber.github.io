	<h1>Ways Emacs Has Changed What I Do</h1>
	<p><a href="https://ryanfaulhaber.com/posts/try-emacs/">Previously</a> I had written about trying Emacs, but looking back on that post I felt like I was bit vague about the ways in which it&rsquo;s changed the things I do, so I wanted to provide some examples. Emacs has replaced a number of programs in my life, and not all of them are developer related.</p>
<h2 id="programming">Programming</h2>
<p>If you can believe it, this is maybe the most underwhelming part. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, though! Emacs is a great editor obviously, and it has all the conveniences of a more modern editor and much more. I did want to talk about what it&rsquo;s like to write code in Emacs though, briefly.</p>
<p>Being a web developer I write a lot of JavaScript, and as you&rsquo;d imagine there&rsquo;s a bunch of extensions in Emacs for writing JavaScript. Emacs has a package called <a href="https://github.com/emacsorphanage/quickrun">quickrun</a> that can evaluate code in buffers on the fly.</p>

<p>As someone who sometimes needs a reminder on the particularities of how certain JavaScript methods work, this is very useful!</p>
<h2 id="journaling">Journaling</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always wanted to get into the habit of journaling. For the last few years of my life I&rsquo;ve been through a couple of journaling apps, some of which I&rsquo;ve paid for! Bur for whatever reason I could never get into the habit. I&rsquo;d start out strong and then stop a week or two in, only to sporadically update.</p>
<p>With Emacs, I&rsquo;ve been journaling almost every day for the last two months or so, and it&rsquo;s all thanks to <a href="https://github.com/bastibe/org-journal">org-journal</a> (I also think it has something to do with the fact that my journal and all my other Org documents live in the same place, and that Emacs provides a very convenient way of creating new journal entries).</p>
<h2 id="blogging">Blogging</h2>
<p>The biggest benefit of Org mode, like Markdown, is that it&rsquo;s a format that can be easily translated into another format. <a href="https://ox-hugo.scripter.co/">ox-hugo</a>, an Org exporter geared towards converting Org documents into Hugo-compatible Markdown files, is now what I use to manage my blog. Blogging is new to me and I only have a few posts under my belt, but almost all of them have been written as Org documents and exported via ox-hugo (or just as GitHub-flavored Markdown when I post the same thing on dev.to).</p>
<h2 id="note-taking">Note-taking</h2>
<p>This is the biggest change.</p>
<p>A lot of what I read could be called academic. Before Emacs I had used Evernote, Notion, Trello, physical notebooks, and other apps that I&rsquo;m probably forgetting to take notes. For some reason it had never occurred to me to take notes as plaintext (I never took notes as Markdown files), but when I learned about Org mode, it seemed natural that I&rsquo;d use it to take notes.</p>
<p>But Emacs let me take it one step further.</p>
<p>I had been reading about <a href="https://zettelkasten.de/">Zettelkasten</a> and learned about <a href="https://roamresearch.com/">Roam Research</a>. The idea of having a flat note hierarchy with links between all your notes (structurally similar to but functionally different than a Wiki) was immediately appealing to me. Of course, because the Emacs ecosystem is so fully featured, there&rsquo;s a package for that: <a href="https://github.com/org-roam/org-roam">org-roam</a>, which is truly a marvel of an Emacs package.</p>
<p>Although I&rsquo;m still in the process of figuring out how the Zettelkasten method can work with a Roam-like system, I&rsquo;ve already taken extensive notes using org-roam: my org-roam directory currently sits at 323 files, though not all of those files have content.</p>
<h2 id="email">Email</h2>
<p>I never thought I&rsquo;d be this person. When you hear about people &ldquo;living&rdquo; in Emacs, this is just part of what they mean.</p>
<p>I host my own private email server (for a guide on how to do this yourself, I strongly recommend <a href="https://www.c0ffee.net/blog/mail-server-guide/">this one</a>. It&rsquo;s the one I used), and I&rsquo;ve never found a great or consistent email client for the desktop. The closest I came was Mailspring, which, although it is nice, it&rsquo;s a bit slow for what it is.</p>
<p>When I first started learning Emacs, I knew you could check your email with it. <a href="https://www.djcbsoftware.nl/code/mu/mu4e.html">mu4e</a> will let you do this. You can read, manage, and send email all from Emacs. You can even write emails as Org documents! It&rsquo;s surprisingly easy and consistent to use. It&rsquo;s best used when your emails are plaintext, but <a href="https://useplaintext.email/">that&rsquo;s generally true too</a>.</p>
<h2 id="and-plenty-more-dot-dot-dot">And plenty more&hellip;</h2>
<p>Emacs has changed a lot of what I do in a lot of small ways that I can&rsquo;t really count. It&rsquo;s really a wonderful program, and I can&rsquo;t believe how much I&rsquo;ve come to really love using it. Every day I feel like I&rsquo;m learning something new about it, and it&rsquo;s all such a joy to use! As I said in my last post, you really should give it a try.</p>
